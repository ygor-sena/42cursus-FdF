[ABOUT MOST USED ALGORITHMS TO DRAW A LINE]

What's the difference between DDA, Bresenham and Mid-point line?

[ABOUT BRESENHAM]

How to implement a very short Bresenham for all cases:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5186939/algorithm-for-drawing-a-4-connected-line

Longer Bresenham for all cases, but easier to understand:

Bresenham algorithm demonstration and proof by Abdul:

Wikipedia page of Bresenham algorithm that explains both implementations above.
	The first one uses integer incremental error, the second one doesn't:

NOTE FOR EVERYONE reading this in the future
Doing a simple linear interpolation on color (to do a degrad√©) IS WRONG as sRGB is not linear see:
